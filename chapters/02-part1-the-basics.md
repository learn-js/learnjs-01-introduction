# Part 1: the basics

## In this section, we'll get started learning:

### Chrome's Developer Tools
All browsers include tools for evaluating, debugging, and auditing your code and your site's performance. This section will introduce you to the tools offered in the browser Google Chrome, and later in the book we'll go into these tools in more detail.

### Basic html and css
For many of our projects in this book, html and css will be kept as minimal as possible. This refresher will get you up to speed if you haven't worked with css or html much before.

### Javascript syntax, variables, data types, and functions
Here we'll go over the basic parts of javascript. We'll cover the equivalents of a programming language's grammar and punctuation, as well as the basic building blocks of javascript: strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, and functions.

### Node.js, npm, & browserify
Server side javascript is a seriously awesome thing, and while this book will only give an introductory look at what's possible, we'll be using many command line tools based on node.js that are installable using `npm`, node's package manager. We'll also introduce browserify, a tool for bundling Node-style modules for the browser that also allows the use of many npm and core Node modules in the browser.

### Testing javascript
Writing tests for your code does two things: ensure your code works as expected when changes are made, and provides examples of usage of your project. When applicable, we'll write the tests for a project first before writing the code that does the real work, and we'll describe later why this is a useful workflow.
