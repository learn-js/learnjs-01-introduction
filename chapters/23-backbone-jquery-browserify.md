# Using Backbone and jQuery with Browserify

Using browserify with modules from npm can be a little overwhelming at first, so what if we were able to use a couple of common front-end development libraries using along with browserify to ease the process of getting started? 

It's possible to build applications using [backbone](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone) and [jquery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) that are bundled by [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify), and in this post we'll take a look at the basics of how that works. We'll use a tool called [beefy](https://github.com/chrisdickinson/beefy) as the development server.

To get started, create a directory for your project, change directory into it, and run `npm init` to create a package.json file for your project:

```
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
npm init
```

Answer the questions from the `npm init` prompt.

## Install jquery and backbone:
`npm install --save jquery backbone`

## Create a view module in a file named app-view.js:

```
var Backbone = require('backbone');
var $ = require('jquery/dist/jquery')(window);
Backbone.$ = $;

module.exports = Backbone.View.extend({
  initialize: function(){
    console.log('wuuut')
    this.render();
  },

  render: function(){
    $('body').prepend('<p>wooooooooooooooo</p>');
  }
});
```

This should look familiar if you've used Backbone before, with the slight variation of exporting the view using module.exports.

There's also the weird require statement for jQuery:

```
var $ = require('jquery/dist/jquery')(window);
```

We have to use the path to the actual jQuery build rather than just pass the module name, and specify `window` so that jQuery actually uses the window object. Otherwise, we'd get an annoying error like this:

```
Uncaught Error: jQuery requires a window with a document
```

This require statement will likely get simpler in upcoming versions of jQuery.

### Create an index.js file with this code to use the module:

```  
    var AppView = require('./app-view')

    var appView = new AppView();
```

## Install browserify and beefy to use to bundle the code and create a dev server:

```
npm install --save-dev browserify beefy
```

Add a `start` command and a 'bundle' command to your package.json scripts object, so that it looks like this:

```
"scripts": {
    "start": "beefy index.js:bundle.js --live",
    "bundle": "browserify index.js -o bundle.js"
  },
```

Now, you can run `npm start` and view the simple Backbone/jQuery app bundled by browserify at `http://localhost:9966`. Beefy will watch your files for changes, then regenerate and serve a bundle.js file and reload the browser window each time you save a file. Convenient!

And when you're ready to deploy your project, you can run `npm run bundle` to get an actual bundle.js file. Host this thing on GitHub Pages or wherever you like.
