# Part 2: In depth with javascript data types

In this section of the book we'll review strings, numbers, arrays, and objects, and focus on a problem that often comes up with each of them.

###Each chapter will follow this pattern:
- Present a problem that needs to be solved
- Describe a possible solution that can be written as a Node.js-style module
- Write tests for the module
- Write the actual module
- Show usage of the module
