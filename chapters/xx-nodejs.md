# In-depth with Node.js


## Install node.js

There are a few options for this, and I've put them in my order of preference:

**Use nvm to manage node versions** This option gives you the most control, allows you to switch between versions of node similar to using rvm or rbenv for Ruby. [Get nvm here](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

**Install using a package manager.** This is a good option, but sometimes package managers can be out of date. If the node version you'll be using matters for your project, you should make sure that the version in the package manager works for you. [Check out a list of package manager instructions here][https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager].

**Download an installer from nodejs.org.
