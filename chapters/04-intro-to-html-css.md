# HTML & CSS: an introduction

If you're new to building projects for the web, knowing javascript alone won't be enough.

This book focuses on javascript, but you'll certainly pick up some html and css along the way.

You might find it useful to learn about html and css before reading Learn.js, or to have a resource handy that you can refer to when you're introduced to new html elements or css properties.

## But here's a quick refresher to get you started:

An example of an html element:

```
<h1>This is a headline</h1>
```

That's an `h1` element. It is used for the most prominent headline of a document – often the site title or article title. Note that this element has an opening tag, `<h1>`, and a closing tag, `</h1>`, which looks the same except it has a forward slash, `/`.

This is a common pattern for html elements. There are a few html elements that don't require closing tags. Like these:

```
<br>
```

The `br` element creates a line break in text.

```
<hr>
```

The `hr` element creates a horizontal rule, a straight line, across your web site. It's usually used as a break between sections.

```
<img src="http://source.com/imagefilename.jpg" alt="this is the alt text of the image" />
```

The `img` element is a little unique. Note that it has a `src` attribute that specifies the image we want to have show up, and an `alt` attribute that provides text that will be displayed for screen readers, or that might be used as a caption. The `img` element is also a self-closing tag, meaning it has a forward-slash before the closing angle bracket.

## HTML attributes and CSS selectors
We just saw the `src` and `alt` attributes on the `img` element. There are many attributes that can be used on any given html element. Some attributes control behavior of the element; some are used as selectors for css rules.

**Here are the two attributes most used as selectors in css rules:**

### `id`

Using the `id` attribute of an html tag looks like this:

```
<p id="introduction">This is the first paragraph of a story.</p>
```

Here we're marking a paragraph (a `p` element) as being the introduction. The `id` of `introduction` should only be used on one html element, making this one `p` element special.

We do this so that later, in the css, we can give the `introduction` different styling than the rest of the `p` elements on the page.

Here's some css that makes the `introduction` italic:

```
p#introduction {
  font-style: italic;
}
```

We don't have to include the `p` in `p#introduction`, but it's useful for clarity. Note the hash mark: `#`. `id` attributes are identified in css by using a `#`.

### `class`
Now, let's say that we want some of the paragraphs in our story to have a different background color to highlight them. One way of accomplishing this would be to add a `class` to these paragraphs.

The use of `class` attributes looks like this:

```
<p class="highlight">This paragraph will be bold and slightly bigger.</p>
```

We've given this `p` element a class of `highlight`, so let's add some css that gives this paragraph a yellow background.

```
p.highlight {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

One of the differences between `id` and `class` attributes is that a `class` can be given to multiple elements on a page, whereas an `id` should be unique to one element. So we can give this class to multiple paragraphs to make them highlighted in yellow.

### Where does the css go?
There are two options: include separate css files, or place css directly in your html file. In almost all situations, including a separate css file for your styles will be a faster and more organized option.

Here's what it looks like to embed css in your html file.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>

  <title>Your website</title>

  <style>

    p.highlight {
      background-color: yellow;
    }

  </style>

</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
```

You'll add your css between the opening and closing `style` tags, which should in turn go between the opening and closing tags of the `head` element.

But the cleaner option is to create a separate css file that you reference from your html file:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>

  <title>Your website</title>

  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />

</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
```

This tells the browser to load the css from the `style.css` file. Having a separate file for your styles helps with keeping your site easy to maintain. Having everything in one big html file can be a pain to work on.

### So where will the javascript be in an html file?

Just as with css, there are a couple options for where you place your javascript code.

You can embed it in your html file between opening and closing `script` tags:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>

  <title>Your website</title>

</head>
<body>

<script>
console.log('this is javascript');
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

Or you can use a `script` tag to reference an external javascript file:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>

  <title>Your website</title>

</head>
<body>

<script src="site.js"></script>

</body>
</html>
```

Note that the `script` element needs a closing tag even though there's nothing between the opening tag and closing tag.

Just like with css, it's better to keep your javascript in a separate files. By separating the types of code in your project you make it easier for yourself and for others to figure out how to make changes. The more organized your project is, the quicker you can revise its design and functionality.

### Layout with html and css
There are a few common tags used for laying out an html document. Check out this example:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>

<title>Your website</title>

</head>
<body>

<header>
    <h1>Your website</h1>
</header>

<main role="main">
  <p>This is the content of your website</p>
</main>

<footer>
  <p>Contact: your info.</p>
</footer>

</body>
</html>
```

We're using the `header` element for the header of the page, the `main` element for the content of the page, and the `footer` element for supplementary information that goes in the footer. All three of these tags are relatively new as part of html5. Another new tag is `section`. You might use it to break up your main content into parts:

```
<main role="main">
  <section id="part-one">
    <h1>Section one</h1>
    <p>This is the content of the first section</p>
  </section>

  <section id="part-two">
    <h1>Section two</h1>
    <p>This is the content of the second section</p>
  </section>
</main>
```

The `section` element is for breaking up your web page into distinct sections. Note that I've got `h1` tags in each of the sections as headers. In html5 anytime you create a new `section` you're allowed to start a new heirarchy of header tags.

Where `section` elements are for specifying blocks of content on your page in a semantic way, `div` elements are used primarily for the positioning and alignment of your content. For example, you might want to use a `div` to act as a container that restricts the width of your content:

```
<section id="part-one">
  <div class="container">
    <h1>Section one</h1>
    <p>This is the content of the first section</p>
  </div>
</section>
```

With css like below you can have the `section` tag the full width of the page while the container stays centered at 800 pixels.

```
.container {
  width: 800px;
  margin: 0px auto 0px auto;
}
```

The `div` is centered by using `auto` for the left and right margins (the order goes top, right, bottom, left).
