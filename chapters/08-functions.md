# Functions

## Eating, digesting, and pooping.

A function is a block of code that takes input, processes that input, and then produces output.

You can think of it like eating, digesting, and pooping.

And when we use a number of functions in succession, it's almost like that movie [The Human Centipede](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1467304/), only less gross.

## Let's make a function named `eat`.

```
// take input / eat food
function eat(food){

  // process the input / digest the food
  var poop = digest(food);

  // send output / poop
  return poop;
}
```

The above example should make sense just from reading it.

Note that lines that start with `//` are comments, and they get ignored when the code is executed.

To create a function, we first write `function`. Next, we can name the function, and in this case it is named `eat`.

Inside of the parentheses we specify the input, which are also called arguments. We only have one argument in this case, named `food`.

Next, we use an opening curly bracket to indicate the beginning of the block of code connected with this function.

We create a variable named `poop`, which contains a "digested" form of the `food` argument. Here we're using another function named `digest` that is using the `food` argument as its own input. 

Finally, we `return poop;` so that the output of this function can be used in other parts of our code.

## Using the `eat` function:

We can use the `eat` function like this:

```
eat('pizza');
```

When we run this, it'll return something like `zpzia`, `apizz`, or `pzazi`.
You know, something random like that.

### So what is the `digest` function doing?

You've probably already guessed that it is a function that randomly shuffles letters in a string. In actual production projects you would want to name it something a little more clear, like`shuffleLetters()`.

Here's an example of the `shuffleLetters()` function using our food/poop language:

```
function digest(food){
  var food = food.split('')
  var digesting = food.length, digested, randomFoodPart;

  while (digesting) {

    randomFoodPart = Math.floor(Math.random() * digesting--);

    digested = food[digesting];

    food[digesting] = food[randomFoodPart];

    food[randomFoodPart] = digested;
  }

  var poop = food.join('');

  return poop;
}
```

You're probably aware that the `digest` function is doing the heavy lifting, while the `eat` function is just a wrapper around `digest`.

If you were really modeling eating, digesting, and pooping using javascript functions, how would you do it?
