# Part 3: Example applications

In this section of the book we'll explore extended examples that show usage patterns for the concepts, modules, and development tools described earlier in the book.

## List of examples:

### Using Backbone and jQuery with Browserify

Using browserify with modules from npm can be a little overwhelming at first, so what if we were able to use a couple of common front-end development libraries using along with browserify to ease the process of getting started? 


### This section is a work in progress

I'm currently working on new examples to include in this part of the book, and it would be wonderful to hear what types of examples you'd like to see! Please email suggestions to hi@learnjs.io.
