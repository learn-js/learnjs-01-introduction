# Introduction to callbacks.

A callback is a function that you pass as an argument to another function.
Typically, you'll use a callback as a way to work with data after it's been processed by a function.

A simple callback looks like this:

```
function holla(callback){
  callback();
}
```

Note how we're setting up an argument named `callback`, then calling that argument as a function: `callback()`.

Usage if the `holla` function:

```
holla(function(){
  console.log('this is part of the callback function);
});
```

Our function named `holla()` takes one argument, and we expect it to be a function. In this example we're using an anonymous function, but we could use a named function like this:

```
function holla(callback){
  callback();
}

function back(){
  console.log('this is part of the callback function);
}

holla(back);
```

But usually we're providing a function some kind of parameter,  that function performs an action on the parameter, then we use the callback to work with the output of the function we called. A simple example looks like this:

```
// create an eat function
function eat(food, callback){
  var food = food + " was eaten";
  callback(food);
}

// create a poop function to use as the callback
function poop(output){
  console.log(output);
}

// call the eat function, passing a food and the poop function as arguments
eat("pizza", poop);
```

Note that when we pass the callback function `poop` as an argument we don't write it like `poop()`. This would _call_ or execute the function, and we don't want that to happen when we pass the `poop` function as an argumet. The `poop` function gets called later inside the `eat` function.
